    "# Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "An instance of a program (e.g., a Python interpreter). It Takes advantage of multiple CPUs and cores. Hence has separate memory space and is not shared between processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Great for CPU-bound processing. \n",
    "2. A new process is started independently from other processes.\n",
    "3. Processes are interruptable/killable.\n",
    "4. One GIL for each process avoids GIL limitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Heavyweight.\n",
    "2. Starting a process is slower than starting a thread.\n",
    "3. More memory.\n",
    "4. IPC (inter-process communication) is more complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Threads:\n",
    "\n",
    "An entity within a process that can be scheduled (also known as a lightweight process). A process can spawn multiple threads and all threads within a process share the same memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lightweight.\n",
    "2. Starting a thread is faster than starting a process.\n",
    "3. Great for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
    "4. No effect for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Threading is limited by GIL: Only one thread at a time.\n",
    "2. Not interruptable/killable.\n",
    "3. Careful with race conditions.\n",
    "4. GIL (Global Interpreter Lock):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# GIL:\n",
    "\n",
    "A lock that allows only one thread at a time to execute in Python. Needed in CPython because memory management is not thread-safe. (CPython has a reference count varaible that keeps count of number of references an object is connected to the variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightweight process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Avoid:\n",
    " - Use a different, free-threaded Python implementation (Jython, IronPython).\n",
    " - Use Python as a wrapper for third-party libraries (C/C++) like numpy, Scipy.\n",
    " - Use multiprocessing."
